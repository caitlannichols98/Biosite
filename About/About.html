                    <p>When he began coding, he used a variety of his technical skills and understandings of the precise detail of coding to create games and other programs. He has given me a brief guide for those wishing to begin said things. That way we all have something to learn from a person rather than the typical online guide that we see with too many ads and revenue pumping.</p>
                    <p>He starts by saying that choosing oneâ€™s appropriate tools is needed. A game development engine, for example, is needed for game creations and research is also needed before choosing said engines. He recommends Unity as a game engine due to its popularity and many guides for it but also Godot and Unreal Engine is a good alternative if one wishes to use something different. He recommends Unity since it uses a well known language and semi easy language to learn but it is also known for its versatility. Unreal engine uses C++, another language that is well known but can be a bit more difficult than C# (like unity) but offers a higher graphic creation when creating games. Godot has its own scripting language that is known as GDScript and a good user friendly interface which can be ideal for beginners.</p>
                    <p>He then adds to this guide that learning the basics is essential. One can not make a building without something holding it up, how can something be help to gether if it has no ground nor beams. If someone is struggling with this concept then courses are available, along with online guides, to help the individual learn simple code to begin. Sketching out the design of the game also helps and compares it to the wireframes of a website, start with a really rough sketch where someone just knows where to put things and can understand the shape if working in a team (or to yourself if its just you). Writing out a really rough storyline and thinking about the controls would be the next steps after getting a semi-good feel of the coding needed for a game that one plans to code (or program, a design has to be made in order for the program to be properly executed and understood).</p>
